## Explore Azure Active Directory features

> Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is a cloud-based identity and access management service. This service helps employees access external resources, such as Microsoft 365, the Azure portal, and thousands of other software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications. Azure Active Directory also helps them access internal resources like apps on your corporate intranet network, along with any cloud apps developed for your organization.


## What are the Azure AD licenses?

Although the three Active Directory-based identity solutions share a common name and technology, they're designed to provide services that meet different customer demands. At a high level, these identity solutions and feature sets are:



## Self-managed Active Directory Domain Services



## Azure Active Directory (Azure AD )

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) - Cloud-based identity and mobile device management that provides user account and authentication services for resources such as Microsoft 365, the Azure portal, or SaaS applications.
Azure AD can be synchronized with an on-premises AD DS environment to provide a single identity to users that works natively in the cloud.


## Managed Azure Active Directory Domain Services



## Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) 

Enterprise-ready lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) server that provides key features such as identity and authentication, computer object management, group policy, and trusts.
AD DS is a central component in many organizations with an on-premises IT environment and provides core user account authentication and computer management features

## Azure Active Directory Domain Services (Azure AD DS) 

Provides managed domain services with a subset of fully compatible traditional AD DS features such as domain join, group policy, LDAP, and Kerberos / New Technology LAN Manager (NTLM) authentication.
Azure AD DS integrates with Azure AD, which can synchronize with an on-premises AD DS environment. This ability extends central identity use cases to traditional web applications that run in Azure as part of a lift-and-shift strategy.
